        <h1>Insatiably Yours</h1>
        <p>I saw in his eyes something familiar and haunting... It seemed to be the same sadness I'd tried to forget, the same sadness that continued to creep, though I swore I'd left it behind. When I recognized the pain reflected in his gaze, I looked away, as many would. After all, we are only human, as they say.<br>

Yet a curious itch began to gnaw at me.. had we endured the same suffering? Slowly, I set aside my uncertainty. As I submitted to the desire to scratch that itch, the answer was revealed. Yes, he did hurt like me. He shared the same wounds that I had cried myself to sleep over so many times. <br>

I didn't know just what had caused that hole in him.. but the hole was there, that much I knew. It had to be, how could it not? I carefully studied him as he attempted to fill it up... yet not once did I notice him rise victorious. I also tried filling my own hole, alongside him, to no avail. Surely, only the truest and most tragic of our world's tormented souls relentlessly drink, dope, or fuck to rid themselves of their daily aching burdens. And we were among them. Does that make us more human, or less human? More, I think, but I know many will disagree. <br>

"Savages!" they will curse. "Penniless dreamers!" they will sneer down their long noses. "No good hooligans!" they will shout from their convertible luxury cars, cars chosen to fit the specifications of the particular void in their own sour souls. <br>

As I noticed that darkness within him, my attention was turned the bright glow eminating from somewhere deep beyond those spiritual flesh wounds. "What a glorious thing," I thought with wonder, "to have both a bleeding broken heart, and a longing lust for life. He must have such an old soul, or perhaps only brand new..." <br>

If he were a very, very old soul, why, that would explain things! A truly ancient soul has traversed just as many different sentient embodiments as there are stars in the sky, and to wind up in a human body seems almost a punishment! Naturally, an old soul would yearn for a more spiritually meaningful existence than the filthy condemnation of humanity.. There must be others like us elsewhere in this vast and glorious expanse we call the universe, ones far less vile and tempestuous than the lot of us. Oh, how awful it must be for an old soul to adjust to humanity, no doubt! Yes, this could cause such an insatiable hunger, such a lonely and a quivering emptiness. Longing for more than what is allowed by humanity's binding limitations could reasonably be a direct consequence of a souls longevity: if a soul has experienced a multitude of lifetimes, then it's also spent much time in the abyss between death and rebirth...<br>

Perhaps, then, for the oldest of souls, that abyss is comforting, as they must be exhausted.. You see, these old souls have not yet passed on to enlightenment; I imagine that, after living so many lives, the abyss would be an absolute comfort. Maybe the void deep inside of him which he mercilessly attempts to fill is caused by the spiritual pain of failing to reach enlightenment, given so many chances. For the man who works every weekday until death, sleep is a great reprieve. I imagine that for these old souls, entering the abyss is much like sleep: restful, rejuvinating, revelatory. <br>

Ah, but if his soul were brand new, as it just as well may be, that would make sense too.. his romantic vision of life could be explained by having a young soul. Of course, a new soul is just as familiar with the void as an old one, relatively speaking, since the void is all a new born soul has ever known, and an old soul knows much more than the void. The abyss is the mother of a new soul.. and a mother is all her child knows, in the beginning.<br>

His undying romance with life could be explained by his young soul's carefree confidence, illuminated innocence, and continual curiousity to explore and absorb as much as possible.. and then some more. I've never met another human being so magnificently curious and beautifully content as him.. the closest equal I can imagine would be a puppy on a walk for the very first time, overwhelmed with exuberance for all the new smells and sensations, held back only by the physical confines of the leash held by his master. <br>

Regardless of his souls true age, I shared with him an intimate awareness of that pain which appears to clutch his very soul, and his hurt mirrors my own. And, I feel the same eagerness to experience every single breath of life I can. I feel the same love for feeling and sharing and exploring and creating that he does, and he feels the same emptiness I feel, when completely alone in the dark, without even my own shadow for company. There is something strikingly beautiful about leading such a life that rides on the wings of the wind. I think, the highs and lows of such a life would allow for the most broadly varying experiences life can offer a person.<br>

The critics will disagree, as they tend to do.. but they find joy in material objects... Things. New things, exclusive things, expensive things.. things, things, and more things.. but we dreamers secure happiness within our pursuits rather than our possessions.. the creation of art, the joy of friendship, the exploration of nature, and reveling in the sunshine of pure love. And, by default, the most exceedingly poetic souls will experience the most, because they have the greatest hunger for life. They will hunt down these experiences even if it kills them, which is what puts said individuals at such a great advantage. The fearlessness of living without regret; the rush that comes when everything works out for the better after taking a chance; the love and appreciation for the individuality and inherent beauty in every living and non-living thing -- these all prove that rather than commiting a slow suicide, a poet is, quite simply, desperately and hopelessly in love with participating in the act of living life. And that is true beauty. <br>

I listened to his words, his beautiful words; his stories and jokes, his ideas... I listened and laughed. I smiled and admired him. I grinned patiently every time he retold a story I'd already heard. I listened on as though I had never before heard something so interesting, because I really hadn't. Even if he told it the same exact way, it didn't matter; every story he told me was better than the last.. <br>

I felt like I had known him for ages when we had really only just met. I was ever drawn to him as more was revealed. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't perfect.. not by a long shot, but his soul shone brightly through his shadow: he was supremely beautiful and heartbreakingly human. <br>

I envied him for his bustling life. Here I was, with few friends and fewer hobbies, in the presence of a soul just as tortured as my own who seemed to have a life overflowing with friendship, adventure, and fantasy. A thought rose in me like a breath of fresh air, and I tried to push it back down as ridiculously romantic nonsense. It rose, again, within my chest, and I couldn't help but think of the ageless, winged man I had dreamt of who had taught me to fly and he showed me how to live again. I dreamt of my winged guide many nights, and longed for his company in my waking life many days. He taught me to navigate my dream world, leading me on exciting adventures and always keeping me entertained. He left my dreams many months ago, and I have, at times, wondered why. Could it be I no longer need him? Is a better teacher on my horizon? Was this man a mere fantasy invented by my subconscious for its own amusement and sanity while in the depths of a devastating depression? Perhaps -- no, surely, I had conjured him up, but then why was this man, the real man, so damn familiar? <br>

His ability to make me smile and laugh gave me hope. I was lost after a ghost from my past broke my heart to bits when he unexpectedly materialized, and, just as quickly, disappeared, but only after I gave myself to him... "Will anyone ever know my soul?" I weeped, fearfully and silently, "Will anyone ever truly understand me again, or am I doomed to wander alone, like a stray dog, into eternity?"<br>

Now I had hope that there were folks out there real enough to crack through your shell in front of, without fear of ridicule and judgment, or worse. My best friend, Ken, was lost in September to a fatal chemical cocktail. This, needless to say, caused great sorrow in my already blackened heart. I lost the person I trusted the most in my life, and I realized it was time to learn to live again. I had been wasting my youth away sitting around in an apartment, and hadn't seen any friends in months. I'd become a hermit. My life was as empty as my bank account is today, but I had a roof and a bed.. and oh, what a bed it was.. <br>

Now, I have no true home -- I am admittedly very blessed to have so many gracious friends offer up their hospitality, as well as their couches. And I've drawn and written and read and socialized more in the past month than in the entire preceding year! Now, how funny is that? I traded in my security for life! It's better than where I was, but it's hard in a different way. I guess that's why they say life is hard, rather than life can be hard, or life is sometimes hard.. Nope, it's just plain tough.<br>

The lonely ocean of his eyes and the pure fancy of his mind reeled me ever closer to him. It happened so gradually and so naturally that I didn't even realize how close I was beginning to get. We spent many hours together, chatting deep into the chill of the night, puffing away on our cancer sticks - American Spirits or Camel filters. But he had so many friends, and some of them were girls... Surely, he saw me as just a friend, I thought to myself bashfully. I should have known that he was always sharing his words and his drinks with me, most likely, for the very same reason it frightened me to look into his eyes.. because we were kindred spirits, who felt the same deep pain of the soul and chaotic passion for life. We were clearly unique, yet strikingly similar. I no longer feared that my soul would never be known... even if he wouldn't be the one to know it, I knew there were people like me out there.. like him. and that gave me hope. <br>

I wondered, some time after we had shared our first kiss, was it that insatiable lust for life that caused our deep pain? Was it that romantic whimsy that indeed caused such terrible emptiness? Was it simply our ability to love with fervency that caused the deep scars within our souls? Are those capable of the deepest love simply condemned to endure equally deep pain? <br>

Suddenly, I realized there was nothing to be afraid of. Familiarity wasn't something to fear, but to embrace. So often do we feel lost and alone, and sadly many of us end up lost at sea in complacency, suffering in a state of pitiful and empty solitude -- but this is often the result of our own insecurities. The feeling of connection experienced through the sharing of stories is infinitely more satisfying than the icy familiarity of pain. If this is lost, we risk forgetting everything.<br>

I no longer feared the pain in his eyes.. Never before had I noticed it within the eyes of another person, I'd never met someone so well acquainted with the same sadness that tortured me.. Not in such a true sense. Within him, the longing for home was constant; and it was as catastrophic as it was splendid. Now, rather than disconcerting me, the pain I met in his eyes actually comforted me. It gave me solace to recognize the suffering of his soul, and that made me feel profoundly human.</p>
